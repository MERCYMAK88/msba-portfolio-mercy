## My Contribution

I contributed most strongly to the machine learning modeling process, particularly building and refining the XGBoost churn prediction model. I worked on creating engineered features, training and tuning the XGBoost model, generating holdout predictions, evaluating performance using AUC/ROC, and interpreting business drivers using SHAP values.


## One Decision I Advocated For

I advocated for using XGBoost rather than relying only on logistic regression because it captures nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables. This improved predictive performance and provided stronger business insight.

## Lessons Learned

One key lesson learned was the importance of clean feature engineering and validating assumptions early in the modeling process. If I had more time, I would improve model calibration and build a simple dashboard to allow business teams to interact with churn predictions more easily.
